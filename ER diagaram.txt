Explanation of Entities:

User: Represents the users of the MyStore application. It stores user-related information such as user_id, username, email, password, and created_at (timestamp for user registration).

Products: Represents the available products in the store. Each product has a unique product_id, name, price, description, and stock_quantity (quantity of the product in stock).

Order: Stores information about customer orders. Each order has a unique order_id, order_date (timestamp for order placement), total_amount (total cost of the order), status (e.g., pending, completed), and a foreign key (user_id) referencing the User entity to establish the relationship with the customer who placed the order.

Cart: Represents the shopping cart for each user. It stores cart-related information like cart_id, created_at (timestamp for cart creation), and a foreign key (user_id) referencing the User entity to link the cart to the user.

Order Items: Represents the items included in each order. It acts as an intermediary table between Order and Products. Each order item has a unique order_item_id, a foreign key (order_id) referencing the Order entity to associate the item with the order, and a foreign key (product_id) referencing the Products entity to link the product in the order.

Transaction: Stores information about payment transactions for orders. Each transaction has a unique transaction_id, a foreign key (order_id) referencing the Order entity to associate the transaction with the order, payment_date (timestamp for payment), and payment_status (e.g., successful, pending).

The ER diagram shows the relationships between the entities:

A user can have multiple orders, represented by the one-to-many relationship between User and Order.
Each order can have multiple order items (products), represented by the one-to-many relationship between Order and Order Items.
Each order can have one transaction, represented by the one-to-one relationship between Order and Transaction.
Each user can have one shopping cart, represented by the one-to-one relationship between User and Cart.
These relationships facilitate the connections between different entities and reflect the functionalities of the MyStore application.
