### 1. Project Overview
The My Store Application aims to provide an intuitive and enjoyable shopping experience for users. It will offer a wide range of products, secure user authentication, shopping cart functionality, and order processing. Additionally, an admin interface will be available to manage products, users, and orders.

### 2. Architecture
The application will follow a three-tier architecture:

MVC Design for MyStore Application
1. Model
The Model component in MyStore is responsible for managing the application's data and business logic. It interacts with the database to fetch and store information about products, users, orders, and other relevant entities.

Key Responsibilities:

Define data structures for products, users, and orders.
Implement data validation and business logic to ensure data integrity.
Perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on the database.
Handle stock management to track product availability.

2. View
The View component is responsible for presenting the user interface to customers and store administrators. It displays the product catalog, shopping cart, order history, login/register forms, and other necessary screens.

Key Responsibilities:

Render HTML templates and user interfaces using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Display product information, prices, and images in an appealing manner.
Enable user interaction with forms and buttons for actions like adding to cart and placing orders.
Provide a responsive design to ensure compatibility with different devices.

3. Controller
The Controller component acts as an intermediary between the Model and View components. It processes user input from the View, updates the Model accordingly, and updates the View with the latest data.

Key Responsibilities:

Handle incoming HTTP requests from the View and invoke the appropriate Model methods.
Manage user sessions and authentication to restrict access to certain functionalities.
Validate user input before passing it to the Model for processing.
Update the View with the latest data from the Model after each action.

### 3. Technologies Used
	Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
	Backend: Java, Spring Boot
	Database: MySQL
	Version Control: Git, GitHub

### 4. Features
The key features of the My Store Application include:

User Registration and Authentication
Product Catalog with Detailed Information
Product Search and Filtering
Shopping Cart Management
Order Placement and Payment Processing
Order History and Tracking
Admin Interface for Product and User Management

### 5. User Interface
The user interface will be designed with a clean and modern look, featuring an intuitive navigation system. Users will be able to access products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases with ease.

### 6. API Endpoints
The backend will expose the following API endpoints:

/api/auth/signup - User registration
/api/auth/login - User login and authentication
/api/products - Retrieve all products
/api/products/{id} - Retrieve a specific product by ID
/api/cart - Retrieve the shopping cart for the authenticated user
/api/cart/add - Add an item to the shopping cart
/api/cart/remove - Remove an item from the shopping cart
/api/orders - Retrieve order history for the authenticated user
/api/orders/{id} - Retrieve a specific order by ID
/api/orders/place - Place a new order

### 7. Database Schema
The MySQL database will consist of the following tables:

users: stores user information (id, username, email, password, etc.)
products: stores product details (id, name, price, description, etc.)
cart_items: stores items added to the user's shopping cart (id, user_id, product_id, quantity, etc.)
orders: stores order details (id, user_id, total_amount, order_date, etc.)
order_items: stores individual items within an order (id, order_id, product_id, quantity, etc.)

### 8. Deployment
The application will be deployed on a cloud platform like Heroku, and continuous integration will be set up using GitHub Actions to automate the deployment process.

### 9. Testing
The application will undergo comprehensive testing, including unit testing and integration testing, to ensure its functionality, security, and reliability.

### 10. Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community. Developers can fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests for review.

### 11. License
The project will be licensed under the MIT License, granting users the freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software.
